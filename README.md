# Algorithms Practice
I worked on all the algorithms. Of course there is room to improve. I will constantly review.

I will review the work on those source code, and then improve the code quality and understand the algorithms better. 
First thing is to get organized, check in github, and review them later. 

I answered [quicksort algorithm question on code review stackexchange.com](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/148062/123986) and then used one of the links here.
